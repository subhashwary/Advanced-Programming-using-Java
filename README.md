Advanced Programming using Java Lab 

Unit 1: Object-Oriented Programming in Java
1. Write Java programs to demonstrate class, object, constructor, and method overloading.
2. Implement inheritance (single, multilevel) and method overriding.
3. Demonstrate the use of abstract classes and interfaces.
4. Implement inner classes and anonymous inner classes.
   
Unit 2: Advanced Language Features
5. Implement programs using Generics (generic class, generic method).
6. Demonstrate the use of Collections Framework – ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap.
7. Implement data processing using Stream API with lambda expressions and method references.

Unit 3: Exception Handling and Multithreading
8. Write Java programs demonstrating try–catch–finally, throw, and throws.
9. Implement a custom exception class.
10. Create a program with multiple threads showing synchronization and inter-thread communication.
11. Implement a producer–consumer problem using threads.

Unit 4: File and I/O Programming
12. Perform file read/write operations using both byte and character streams.
